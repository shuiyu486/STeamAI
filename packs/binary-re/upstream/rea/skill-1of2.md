# REA

Use REA when a claim depends on a shipped binary or package, decompilation,
passive application runtime evidence, or comparison with
behavior not established by available source. For ordinary analysis of a
complete source repository, use normal repository tools and do not run REA
readiness or provider commands.

## Connect only when needed

Installing this skill supplies instructions; it does not register the REA MCP
server, install analysis engines, or add tools to an already-running agent.

If REA tools are available and their registration is not known to be stale,
proceed directly to the target. Do not run diagnostics or setup before every
investigation. Use the connected server's actual tool list and input schemas;
a skill installed from repository main may describe capabilities absent from
an older npm release. Keep complete inline Evidence when that server does not
advertise retained references.

If tools are absent, a call is blocked by the client, or a required provider is
unavailable, read [connection and recovery](references/connection-and-recovery.md).
Diagnose the observed blocker, continue useful supported work, and resume the
original task after repair. Client approval, shell PATH, registration and engine
availability have different remedies; avoid repeating setup for all of them.

1. Diagnose without changing REA or client configuration. `npx` may download
   the package and write to npm's cache. For Codex, run
   `npx -y rea-agents@latest doctor --client codex --json`. Substitute the current
   supported client: `claude_code`, `claude_desktop`, `codex`, `cursor`,
   `gemini_cli`, `windsurf`, `devin`, `opencode`, `antigravity`, `copilot_cli`,
   `commandcode`, `vscode`, `grok_build`, `omp`, or `grok_bot`. `grok_bot` has no local
   file registration: doctor reports the Grok Bot chat step, and setup does not
   write `mcp.json`. If the client is unknown, use `doctor --json` and
   inspect its registration results before choosing a setup scope.
2. Distinguish the reason. Missing, malformed, or stale registration needs a
   scoped configuration repair. An aligned registration with no tools in the
   active session needs a restart/reconnection; doctor cannot prove that the
   current agent has connected. A missing provider affects only tasks requiring
   that provider: static JavaScript inspection needs neither Hopper nor Ghidra,
   and Android inspection has separate bring-your-own JADX/Java prerequisites.
3. For a configuration repair, prepare the read-only plan:
   `npx -y rea-agents@latest setup --client codex --dry-run --json`.
   Use the current client's ID, show its exact proposed paths, backups, and
   changes, and obtain approval before setup writes configuration or installs
   Hopper. Setup normally installs the matching bundled skill too; include that
   replacement in the reviewed plan. After approval, apply the same scope with
   `npx -y rea-agents@latest setup --client codex --yes`. Add `--install-hopper`
   only if that separate installation was needed and explicitly approved.
4. Restart/reconnect the affected agent. Verify that REA tools actually appear
   in the session, then resume the original investigation. If they remain
   absent, inspect the client's MCP launch error rather than repeating setup.

REA setup never installs or upgrades Node.js, npm, Homebrew, Java, Ghidra, IDA,
JADX, Kuna, Binwalk, or Unblob. Use existing prerequisites; do not install unrelated
software to repair
MCP registration. For an unsupported client, use manual stdio registration
with a version-pinned `rea-agents` package or continue through the CLI.

A concrete CLI fallback for an operator-supplied JavaScript tree or ASAR is:

```bash
npx -y rea-agents@latest analyze-javascript-application /absolute/path/to/app --json
```

No MCP registration or native engine is required. Read the returned Evidence,
graph, limitations, and unknowns with the same care as an MCP result; the CLI
returns the Evidence record directly. This fallback does not establish that
MCP is configured. Native CLI tasks still require their selected engine.
Prefer an existing `rea` CLI. When none is installed and REA package acquisition
is within the authorized scope, use `npx -y rea-agents@latest` in its place.
Configuration repair starts with a read-only setup plan; show paths, backups and
skill replacement before applying authorized changes. Preserve existing approval
and target-execution boundaries. REA setup never installs or upgrades unrelated
software, including Node.js, npm, Homebrew, Java, Ghidra, IDA, JADX, Kuna, Binwalk or Unblob.

## Route the target first

Choose the first tool from the target the user supplied. Use `open_binary` for
active-target native or archive workflows; target-free tools take their own
explicit path or endpoint and do not need it.

- ASAR or extracted JavaScript/Electron tree:
  `analyze_javascript_application`.
- Archive/package member inventory (ZIP/APK/IPA/MSIX/AppX or DMG):
  `open_binary` with the supplied local path; use `inspect_artifact` when its
  graph and findings help answer the question.
- Android APK code, classes, methods, or incoming references:
  `inspect_android_package`, then focused Android tools when advertised.
  Archive member inventory still uses the archive route above.
- Managed PE/CLI assembly: `inspect_managed_artifact`.
- Firmware image: `inspect_firmware_regions` when advertised. Use
  `extract_firmware` when extraction is requested, with a caller-selected new
  absolute output directory. These tools use caller-supplied Binwalk/Unblob on
  Linux; see the [firmware guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/firmware-analysis.md).
- .NET NativeAOT PE/ELF: native Ghidra analysis. Native code can yield pseudocode;
  consult the NativeAOT workflow in `references/native-and-artifacts.md` for
  optional metadata recovery and its supported host/layout boundary.
- User-owned browser page already open: `list_browser_targets`.
- Browser action the agent must perform (click, type, navigate):
  `capture_browser_scenario` with declared actions. See
  [runtime observation](references/runtime-observation.md) for connect/launch
  and the focused follow-up browser tools.
- Fiddler Everywhere traffic or a native `.saz` capture: read the
  [Fiddler workflow](references/runtime-observation.md#fiddler-everywhere-traffic-debugging).
  Inspect saved SAZ with `inspect_web_network_capture` and `format: "saz"`;
  connect Everywhere's separate MCP server for live traffic.
- Retained HAR/SAZ/native mitmproxy/aioquic qlog capture: `inspect_web_network_capture`. Select
  original record ordinals when useful; inspect producer fields and byte/number
  sidecars without fetching recorded URLs or claiming live attribution. See
  [historical captures](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/web-network-captures.md) for the exact upstream
  profile and credential exclusions. Qlog support starts with aioquic 1.5.0
  JSON 0.3; stream coverage and endpoint loss declarations do not recover bodies
  or establish network loss. Prefer detail summary, then kind qlog trace/stream
  pages; select one trace, stream ID and direction for contribution/range pages.
  Facts retain all-recorded-events-before-selection scope. Other qlog layouts
  and PCAP correlation are unsupported.
- User-owned Electron runtime already open: `list_electron_targets`. Before an electron-main Inspector attempt, check packaged fuses with `inspect_electron_fuses`; disabled `EnableNodeCliInspectArguments` means the app ignores `--inspect`.
- Packet-field discovery: `inspect_packet_fields` searches installed protocols
  and field names/types before choosing fields for `inspect_packet_capture`.
  Query/page the relevant records; registrations do not establish observed traffic.
- Recorded packet captures: `inspect_packet_capture` with selected TShark fields,
  display filters and decode-as rules. Requires Linux, util-linux prlimit and `REA_TSHARK_COMMAND`; see
  [capture guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/packet-captures.md).
  Packet limits count input packets before filtering. Output defaults to 50 matching
  frames; use `match_offset` / `match_limit` for later pages, or explicit null
  limit for complete matching output. Preserve the source digest across pages.
  This does not perform live capture.
  For address/DNS/SNI/protocol summaries use `inspect_pcap_capture` with MCP
  detail summary, then retained kind pcap pages. Requires Wireshark 4.x tshark
  and capinfos, with Linux prlimit or Windows Job Objects; see
  [packet summaries](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/pcap-analysis.md).
  Select an exact DNS question for address pages; page exhaustion does not prove
  network completeness. This reads recordings and does not acquire traffic.
- Decoder discovery: `inspect_signal_decoders` searches installed decoder IDs
  or selected decoder help, including channels and options. Query and page the
  relevant details before choosing settings; this does not scan hardware.
- Recorded logic/signal traces: `decode_signal_recording` with explicit decoder,
  channel and protocol settings. On Linux with util-linux prlimit, supply sigrok-cli 0.7.2 through
  `REA_SIGROK_COMMAND`; see [recording guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/signal-recordings.md).
  Output defaults to 50 literal lines; select annotation classes and page with
  `line_offset` / `line_limit`, or explicit null for all remaining output.
  Window counts are display lines, not annotations or samples. Preserve source digests across pages.
  This reads existing files; it does not acquire hardware signals.
- Explicit local WebAssembly artifact: `inspect_wasm_artifact`. Supply WABT 1.0.42
  through `REA_WABT_BIN_DIRECTORY`; retain exact byte/tool identity and decoded WAT.
  Select JavaScript glue and candidate paths explicitly and preserve URL/path
  ambiguity. No implicit fetch or target execution; WAT is not original source.
  See the [WASM guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/wasm-artifacts.md).
- Explicit local EVM bytecode carrier: `inspect_evm_interface` with caller-selected
  `raw` or `hex` encoding. Preserve carrier/decoded digests and treat selectors,
  argument strings and mutability as inferred candidates; this performs no chain
  lookup or target execution. For the complete inferred interface without hex or
  duplicate stdout, discover support and select `detail: "summary"`; complete
  Evidence stays retained under its original identity. Use the returned
  `parent_evidence_id` for exact function or `bytecode_hex`/stdout/stderr pages.
  Candidate coverage does not establish interface completeness. See the
  [EVM bytecode guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/evm-bytecode.md).
- Embedded Go compiler, module or build-setting metadata: `inspect_go_binary`
  with the explicit local file. This built-in target-free inspection requires no
  Go installation or disassembler. Preserve raw module bytes and source ranges;
  absent metadata does not prove a binary is not Go, and unparsed text records
  remain explicit. See the
  [Go binary guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/go-binaries.md).
- Embedded cargo-auditable Rust dependency metadata: `inspect_rust_binary`
  with the explicit local ELF, PE, or thin Mach-O file. This built-in
